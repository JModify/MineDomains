# -- General Information --
# This configuration file is used to edit all menus/guis which the plugin
# displays to the user. All standard menus are titled as their name,
# while anvil menu's (menu's the player can input text into anvils)
# are titled with the prefix 'anvil'.
#
# Filler items for all standard menus are able to be configured however,
# their name and lore etc. cannot be changed for obvious reasons.
#
# Slots for items/icons in the standard menus can also be changed, however
# do not make the slot of an icon outside the range of the total slots in the
# menu otherwise bad things might happen.
#
# -- Placeholder Information --
# Placeholder API is supported for this plugin. It is a soft-depend meaning
# you can choose to have it installed. If you try to use placeholders in
# any of the strings below which are a part of placeholder API, and you
# do not have the api running on your server, the placeholders will not
# be replaced.
# Additionally, some of the menu's below have in-built placeholders which
# are there by default. These must be used somewhere in the section where
# they are found as they are required for the given menu to work properly.
#
#
# -- Standard GUI Information --
# {MENU}.name : name of gui displayed at the top
# {MENU}.slots : total amount of slots for the given menu.
# {MENU}.filler : filler item used to fill empty inventory slots.
# {MENU}.{ICON}.name : display name for icon.
# {MENU}.{ICON}.lore : lore displayed below name for icon.
# {MENU}.{ICON}.slot : slot which icon should be located inside menu.
# {MENU}.{ICON}.material : material type for this icon
# {MENU}.{ICON}.enchant-glow : whether the item should have an enchant glow or not.

# -- Anvil GUI Information --
# {MENU}.name : name of gui displayed at the top
# {MENU}.item : the left slot input of a given anvil menu.
# {MENU}.item.name.: display name for icon.
# {MENU}.item.lore: lore displayed below name for icon
#
# NOTE: Unfortunately due to limitations with anvil menu's. The output
# item (item you click to confirm), cannot be edited and will just
# take on the form of the "item" icon but with an updated name.
